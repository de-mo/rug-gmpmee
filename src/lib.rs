//! The rug-gmpmee crate provides an implementation for [rug](https://docs.rs/rug/latest/rug/) of
//! the [GMP Modular Exponentiation Extension (GMPMEE)](https://github.com/verificatum/verificatum-gmpmee),
//! which is a minor extension of [GMP](https://gmplib.org/). It adds simultaneous modular exponentiation
//! and fixed base modular exponentiation functionality to the set of integer functions (the mpz-functions),
//! as well as special purpose primality testing routines.
//!
//! It contains the following implementations:
//! - Multi-exponentation (`spowm`)
//! - Fixed base exponentiation (`fpowm`). It contains a possibility to cache the precomputation table
//! - Miller-Rabin primality test
